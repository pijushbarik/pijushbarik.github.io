Wellcome to my first ever blog post.

I am going to write this blog as a memoir or lika a diary for me to keep notes in a single place. Here I will post about tips and tricks, and mostly about prgramming problems &amp; stuffs I come across while fixing or implementing a feature.

Let me test my highlighting and formatting. _(test in production)_ 🤫

Except coding I like to...

- Reading books
- Riding my bike
- Watching crime thriller movies and TV series
- ... and doing more coding 😐

Meet my cat, Suji

Here is a quote from me,

> Umm, it works on my machine!

[Here is something to make your day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ "Here is something to make your day")

And, let's not forget my (and almost everyone's) first written **Hello World** program from where I begin my journey

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <conio.h>

int main() {
	clrscr();
	printf("Hello world!\n");
	getch();
	return 0;
}
```

Yup, works!
