This repo contains the codebase for my personal website <a href="https://pijushbarik.ml">https://pijushbarik.ml</a>. The built code is served from `Netlify` from the `prod` branch. Any new features or changes will be merged and tested on `dev` branch before merging to `prod`.

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Start developing**

    ```shell
    npm run develop
    # or
    npm start
    ```

    Webpack will start with hot reloading in `http://localhost:8000`

<br />

2.  **Make a production build**

    ```shell
    npm run build
    ```

    A production build will be created in `public` directory

    <br />

3.  **Other `NPM` commands**

    ```shell
    # to clean the cache and build directory
    npm run clean

    # to format the codebase with Prettier
    npm run format

    # to serve a compiled production build
    npm run serve
    ```

## ðŸ’¡ Future plans

- Add blog to the website
